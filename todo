- improve logging - remove the std::cout logs at start of spaceinvaders.cpp
- add a morphing sound - currently using a copy of the invaderkill sound
- add more formations and levels
- add a game over state, a sos state, and a state to enter name into score table
- add mothership collisions 
- handle collisions between alien and player missiles
- when the last alien gets to the bottom of the screen the game switches to another state
  where an alien spawns at the top of the screen, dropping decoys, moving quickly from left to
  right, do I want to implement this?
- implement the schrodinger reinforcements
- investigate and fix why the game isnt scaling when I resize the window.
- fix the 'b' on the splash screen
- make it possible to skip the splash screen
- add a cheat mode which can be activated via a cli arg or via a .cfg file
- implement the music beats
- draw one of the cabinet arts for the background? see here,
    http://www.classicgaming.cc/classics/space-invaders/graphics
  artwork 2 looks most appropriate
- a sign that pops up detailing the round number when aliens are spawning?
- draw the cannons on the hud to show num lives - was drawing with old hud system that I
  stripped but not the new one. (is it even possible with the current setup of the new one?)
- add the option to play the space invaders song instead of the beats? (or both?)
- the high score system
